                                                    Criteria
Your server must do the following:

- Have User Authentication
- Follow an MVC pattern.
- Persist data to Postgres.
- Use all of the key concepts studied in this Gitbook, including jwt, bcrypt, and middleware.
- You will build a client later, using React. You do not need a client for this. We will use this to teach client side Authentication with React. 
- Your endpoints must show signs of having been tested(screenshots of successful Postman request in a Readme.md file are always handy)
